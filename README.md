# Dresden-Files-for-Hero-Lab
This is a basic data set for Hero Lab. Copy these files to Hero Lab's fatecore data folder.

When you start Hero Lab, load the FATE Core System.

You can choose a template and supernatural powers by click "Add a Stunt"
In the "Configure Your Character" window, select "Dresden Files" as a source.
Click in the now empty "Campaign" area, and select your desired power level for your character(s).

Before selecting any skills or stunts, makd sure you select a template. To select a template, click the "Skills and Stunts" tab.
Scroll to the bottom of the skills and stunts window, and select "Add a Stunt".
Scroll down until you see the list of templates (they're labeled as such), and select the one you want.
For instance, you'll see:
   Template: Champion of God
   Template: Changeling
   Template: Emissary of Power
   (and so on ...)

Supernatural powers are also selected via "Add a Stunt". As templates are prefaced with "Template:", supernatural powers are prefaced with "P/(category)". For example:
   "P/CF: Aquatic" indicates that this is a supernatural power in the "Creature Feature" category.
   "P/FM: Glamours" is a supernatural power in the "Faerie Magic" category.
   "P/IT: Sword of the Cross" is an "Item of Power".
   (and so on ...)
